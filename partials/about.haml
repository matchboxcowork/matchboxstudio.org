      MatchBOX is a place to work for those who don't have places to work.
      Think of a coffee shop mashed up with an office park in an old garage.
      It's a room full of desks with all the amenities you need to get work
      done: 24-hour secure access, conference rooms, the fastest internet in
      town, and an unlimited supply of coffee and snacks.

      It's a great place to start a new business, or to grow an existing small
      business. It's for the hobbyist with a crazy new idea, the moonlighting
      entrepreneur, or the professional office nomad. It's for developers,
      designers, strategists, artisans, writers, makers, and change-makers of
      all types. It's a home for the creative class in Lafayette, West
      Lafayette, and throughout the midwest.

      Bring a laptop or a backpack, but leave your tie at home. Find a place to
      work for a few hours, or reserve your own desk and chair. Put on your
      headphones and work undisturbed all night long, or ask a desk neighbor
      for some advice or grab some coffee at the bar with an advisor. The space
      is about the people there, and we only ask that you be willing to
      contribute to the success of the others around you.

      We have a box. We're looking for matches...people with a dream about to
      catch on fire. We want to make it easy for you to work, help you
      collaborate, and stoke the flames.

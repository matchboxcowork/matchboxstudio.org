              %h3 HISTORY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
              %p The modern era of entrepreneurship has evolved since the term was introduced by French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, in the early 1800s. Say’s focus was on the OPTIMIZATION of resources as a result of shifting them from lower to higher areas of productivity; a definition that would be fitting of a wide array of entrepreneurial endeavors even today. In the 20th century, Austrian-American economist and political scientist Joseph Schumpeter focused his definition of entrepreneurship on the role of DISRUPTION, or “creative destruction,” as the primary driver in economic growth.
              %p Later that century, Peter Drucker, an American management consultant and educator, focused on entrepreneurs as best defined by those who spot and exploit OPPORTUNITY in order to be successful. Howard Stevenson, a contemporary Harvard School of Business professor, has more recently expounded on the RESOURCEFULNESS of the entrepreneur as their most distinguishing trait, which doesn’t allow resources to limit their options.

              %p The authors of this paper would like to contribute to this great history of entrepreneurship by adding that VISION may be the most useful trait of a modern entrepreneur as it considers the motivation of the entrepreneur; the critical element of pursuing entrepreneurial activity not as much out of what could be, but more of a fixing of the present in light of a future picture of “the way that things should be.”
              %p As the definition has evolved, it has grown from a simple umbrella term that identifies any individual who can optimize resources to a more focused, opportunistic and innovative person with a desire to deconstruct the status quo to solve a problem. In other words, the shift from a Small and Medium Enterprise focus to an Innovation Driven Enterprise focus is clear, and mirrors the evolution of the entrepreneurial culture across the country and, more importantly, in Greater Lafayette.

Key areas of differentiation include market opportunities, funding options, response to capital, growth potential, and job opportunities.

              %h3 Market Opportunity
              %p From a market opportunity perspective, SMEs tend to focus on a local market. For example, a retail operation or dining establishment caters to the needs of the potential custom- ers that are in their direct proximity. Conversely, IDEs tend to have global opportunities in a very niche market. Consider high-tech intellectual property, such as a cloud-based data software product, that can significantly impact or alter an industry or series of industries around the globe, and thereby access global markets and leapfrog revenue projections confined to a local geography.

              %h3 Jobs
              %p The types of jobs that are created by SMEs are generally performed locally and may or may not be able to transfer to other industries. Job creation by IDEs, though, often results in tradeable opportunities for a global workforce wherein jobs can be performed remotely anywhere in the world. The necessary skills for these positions are frequently transferable as well. An individual who writes software in the agricultural industry can often do the same in another industry—education, manufacturing, etc.

              %p For an SME, traditional funding options are relatively straightforward: banks provide small business loans to individuals or partnerships that are deemed low-risk, based on a trusted formulaic analysis that’s been improved over time. These same risk management calculations don’t work in favor of IDEs, as they often have a period of latency after funding from research and development. The acceptance of failure in the support of IDEs is critical to encourage this type of startup activity to thrive.
              %p Funding options for IDEs, beyond the simple but effective “boot strapping,” can be nondilutive long-in- vestment interest in the form of grant opportunities from sources like SBIR/STTRs from Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interi- or, Transportation, EPA, NASA, and especially the NSF, as well as other national and more regional organizations, or dilutive with investment opportuni- ties from common places such as angel investors and venture capital (VC) firms.

                “Innovative risk takers are likely to become serial entrepreneurs, reinvesting the gains from their initial business in successive employment-generating enterprises. Entrepreneurs themselves are central to economic growth, accounting for one-third of the difference in economic growth rates among countries.”

              %p A single-word approach to summarize the variances between the two categories of entrepreneurial activity is to refer to SMEs, or traditional small businesses, as evolutionary. The growth of the organization is steady and consistent, but can be slow and limited. When ran well, they can continue and do well for generations, but change is often slow. Conversely, IDEs, or startups, are revolutionary. They’re disruptive by nature, and albeit volatile, they can cause rapid and immediate growth and change.
